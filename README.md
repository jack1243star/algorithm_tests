# Algorithm Tests

Includes several small programs to try out algorithms, using real subroutines from HM.

The `lib` directory contains code from HM. See `compile.bat` for compiling.

Rest of the directories such as `basis_functions`, `matching_pursuit` and `scan_order` uses LÃ–VE with LuaJIT to implement algorithms and visualize the results. Each `lua` directory contains FFI bindings to the C subroutines.
